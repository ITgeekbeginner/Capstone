This project implements a Recipe Manager API using Django and Django REST Framework. It allows users to manage recipes by creating, updating, deleting, and viewing them by category or ingredient. The API also provides authentication, search functionality, and the ability to filter recipes by various attributes such as preparation time and servings.
